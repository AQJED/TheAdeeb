            <h1>Sabotaged by a Checkbox: How Bloatware Killed My Demo</h1>
            
            <h3>The Setup</h3>
            <p>
                The sprint was completed ahead of schedule. The backend networking and system-to-system communication had been verified in the development environment. I had a stable build, the scenarios were mapped out, and I was 30 minutes away from a stakeholder demonstration.
            </p>

            <h3>The Silent Exit</h3>
            <p>
                During a final sanity check, the application failed to launch. There was no exception, no crash dump, and no error message. The process simply terminated immediately after execution. Even with the debugger attached, the entry point was never reached. 
            </p>

            <div class="callout">
                "I couldn't find the cause in the logs. I had to make the call: Demo postponed."
            </div>

            <h3>Hunting for Ghost Code</h3>
            <p>
                I spent the next hour tracing the execution flow through manual logging and system monitoring. The logs indicated that the application was failing during the initialization of the core dynamic link libraries (DLLs).
            </p>
            <p>
                The behavior was strange. I would rebuild the project, verify the DLLs existed in the folder, and attempt to run the executable. Upon execution, the DLLs would be deleted from the filesystem in real-time. This pointed to an external process with high-level permissions.
            </p>

            <h3>The Cost of "Next, Next, Finish"</h3>
            <p>
                The issue was environmental contamination. Earlier that day, I had installed a utility to manage GPU fans on the delivery machine. I had bypassed the manual installation options and inadvertently allowed a bundled "trial" of Norton Antivirus to install.
            </p>
            <p>
                Norton’s heuristic engine flagged my unsigned networking DLLs as a security threat due to the raw socket manipulation. It was silently quarantining and deleting the binaries as soon as the application attempted to load them into memory. There was no notification; the software was simply neutralizing what it perceived as malicious behavior.
            </p>

            <h3>Protect Your Environment</h3>
            <p>
                The demo had to be postponed to clean the environment. This was a failure of environment control. As a solo developer, it is easy to forget how much power third-party utilities have over your system.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Development Isolation:</strong> A machine used for compiling and testing low-level systems must remain clean. Third-party utilities should not be installed on the same machine as the development environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Heuristic Interference:</strong> When working with custom binaries, consumer-grade security software is a liability.</li>
                <li><strong>Read the dialogs:</strong> Rushing an installation can introduce variables that compromise days of engineering work.</li>
            </ul>
