            <h1>The Interpreter Tax: Why I Traded Delegation for Speed</h1>
            
            <h3>The Premise</h3>
            <p>
                There is a golden rule in management: "Delegate." They tell you that a senior engineer should be a "force multiplier," lifting up the team.
            </p>
            <p>
                But in integration engineering, there is a dirty secret. Sometimes, the gap between <em>what needs to be done</em> and <em>what the other person knows</em> is so wide that delegation becomes a liability.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recently faced a choice: I needed a GUI for my middleware. I had a colleague who was a "GUI Guy," but he had never worked on low-latency software, and physics wasn't his strength.
            </p>

            <h3>1. The "Interpreter Tax"</h3>
            <p>
                The biggest cost in software isn't typing; it's downloading the architecture from my brain into yours.
            </p>
            <p>
                To get a standard GUI developer to build a flight control panel correctly, I can't just say "Make a button." I have to explain why the backend runs on a high-priority UDP loop. I have to explain why blocking the main thread for 10ms to render a fancy animation will cause the physics engine to stutter.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it takes me 4 hours to teach a crash course in "Real-Time Thread Safety" just to get a working progress bar, I haven't saved time. I’ve paid the <strong>Interpreter Tax</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>2. The Low-Latency Blind Spot</h3>
            <p>
                Developers who live in the world of standard apps often view "performance" differently than we do in defense simulation. To them, a 100ms delay is "snappy." To us, it's a missed frame.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
                "If I let a junior dev touch the GUI that drives critical middleware, I have to spend time protecting my code from theirs. I end up building a 'padded crib' for the GUI so it doesn't crash the simulation."
            </div>
            <p>
                It is significantly faster to build the house myself than to build a house <em>and</em> a safety cage around it.
            </p>

            <h3>3. The "Reference Implementation" Strategy</h3>
            <p>
                My decision to "do it myself" wasn't about arrogance. It was about proof.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent the time learning Qt and building the GUI myself first. This wasn't to exclude the other developer, but to create a <strong>Reference Implementation</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                By building the first version, I established the constraints. I proved that the UI could update at 60Hz without locking the backend.
            </p>

            <h3>The Verdict</h3>
            <p>
                Now, I can hand that code to the GUI specialist and say: <em>"Here is the baseline. Make it prettier, add features, but do not break the timing loops."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm always open to help, and I want them to learn. But in high-stakes integration, you have to build the foundation yourself to make sure the cement dries correctly.
